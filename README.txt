# chicken-farm
    The project is about Mama Amina Chicken Farm System. Mama Amina has a chicken farm about 1200 chickens. The system will enable her to add, update, edit amount of eggs sold and the remaining. Also it will help her to keep track of the food present in the stock. Also keep track of how many chickens availble in farm, how many were sold, how many are male and female, how many are young and so forth.      
    At first it will be stand alone but in time will be hosted so that the customers can be able to press their     orders for either buying some eggs or chickens or both.
