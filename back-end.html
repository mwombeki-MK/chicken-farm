         Then the database will be created with at least for tables; chickens, food,
         eggs and users. All information will be added to the database for storage
	     and MYSQL will be used and PHP will be the server side language.          
      </p>
      <p>
      	Since PHP will be a serverside language, I will use a codegniter as my framework
		because it is very easy and fun working with this framework and good for organisation
		of the codes.
